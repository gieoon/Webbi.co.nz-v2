                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>
                    We're a web design & development studio located in Nelson on New Zealand's South Island. 
                    We're grateful to live in the sunniest place in New Zealand, but it sure makes it hard to stay coding indoors when it's constantly so beautiful outside.
                    {/* and in 2019 experienced over 2500 hours of sunshine. */}

                    <br/><br/>
                    We're comfortable with a variety of technologies and can come up with a design for just about anything. We can update your website, add a blog page, or create a new image for your business. Get in touch with us for a quick discussion on what you're after.
                    {/* Let's work together to help grow your business.  */}
                    
                     {/* around your options and possibilities. */}
